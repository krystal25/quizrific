# quizrific

Quizrific is a mobile application dedicated to students and professors to help them better prepare for courses.
Professors can: 
- create/edit/delete multiple-choice quizzes 
- schedule the quizzes for the students to take at a certain time and hour
- see statistics of how the students performed after a taken quiz
- communicate with the students in real-time

Students can:
- take scheduled quizzes created by their professors 
- practice on questions from the API offered by Open Trivia Database
- track their progress in various charts
- challenge one another in a real-time multiplayer game where they can compare their knowledge

The app is made using Java, MySQL, PHP, node.JS, JavaScript, socket.io.
I have also integrated the API from Open Trivia DB.
